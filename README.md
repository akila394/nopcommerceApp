# Web Automation of NopCommerce App
### Objective

The objective of this project is to create a Selenium hybrid automation testing framework and implement scripts to automate functional tests in the backend e-commerce web application of NopCommerce. The framework will facilitate efficient and reliable testing of the application's functionalities, ensuring its quality and accuracy.

### Key Tasks
1. **Creation of Test Automation Suite:** Develop a test automation suite in Selenium using Python, employing a hybrid test architecture that incorporates the Page Object Model (POM), Data Driven Framework, and Pytest. This architecture will enhance the maintainability and scalability of the test suite.

2. **Log Files and Screenshots:** Capture log files and screenshots of failed test cases to aid in debugging and error analysis during test execution.

3. **Support for Multiple Browsers:** Configure the framework to run tests on desired browsers, including cross-browser and parallel browser settings, ensuring compatibility and reliability across different environments.

4. **Automated Test Scripts for Login and Customer Modules:** Develop automated test scripts for the login and customer modules of the NopCommerce application. These scripts will validate the functionality and performance of these key modules.

5. **HTML Test Reports:** Generate HTML reports that present comprehensive test results, including detailed test execution reports, providing clear visibility into the outcomes of each test run.

6. **GitHub Integration:** Upload the project to your GitHub repository and commit changes accordingly, facilitating version control and collaboration.

7. **Jenkins Integration:** Configure Jenkins to build the project and execute the automation runs, enabling continuous integration and testing.

### Outcome
The project successfully delivers a Selenium hybrid automation framework for automating the NopCommerce web application. It includes test scripts for the login and customer modules, implemented using the POM, Data Driven Framework, and Pytest. The modular nature of the framework allows for easy incorporation of new test scripts, ensuring test coverage and scalability.
